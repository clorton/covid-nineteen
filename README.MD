## json-to-pandas

"Does anyone have the capacity to write a quick python script that makes acs5_variable_listing.json into a pandas dataframe with table IDs (BXXXXX) and concept? I rarely work with jsons and can't wrap my head around this right now. If possible, then upload it to the seattle_networks Dropbox folder. Thanks!" @Dina Mistr (#seattle-network)
